            <p>Are you looking for an agent that can get the job done? I have sold real estate in the Bay Area since
              1977.
              I have been averaging 50 homes or more sold each year since 1997 and have sold thousands of homes and
              investment properties during my career as a real estate agent. I belong to several real estate boards and
              cover a wide area to service my buyers and investors. I have worked with many investors on exchanging real
              estate investment properties. I maintain a full-time staff to assist my clients.</p>

          <p>I build my business one client at a time. I have made <span style="font-style: italic;">service</span> a
            trademark of my business and enjoy long term relationships with my clients. My team includes a transaction
            coordinator, an assistant and escrow managers. We possess a fervor for real estate that
            has benefited my clients and their home-buying aspirations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3 style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px;">My Vision</h3>
          <p>I have established a reputation for integrity, professionalism and devoted service. I look forward to
            working with you to help you satisfy your real estate needs and investment goals.<br> I have completed
            several tax courses along with exchange courses. Many tax-deferred exchanges have been done for clients
            since the 1986 Tax Reform Act. I have a separate property management division, Comprehensive Property
            Services that helps clients manage property if they do not wish to be involved in the daily operation of
            rentals.</p>

          <h3 style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px;">My Value</h3>
          <p>I have a long association with many professionals who will help prepare a home or apartment building for
            the market. I can pass along discounts on new carpet, carpet cleaning and painting to clients who need these
            services. Due to the large volume of property that I list and sell, my clients receive priority from outside
            professionals when we need to get a property "market ready."</p>

          <p>I am a transplanted Californian and have lived in the Bay area for almost 40 years. I love living here and
            enjoy the weather, the diversity and the incredible flow and exchange of ideas. Through Rotary, I have
            become involved in working with Rotaplast, an organization devoted to repairing cleft lip and
            cleft palates in children and adults in developing countries. I have
            worked on funding missions since 2006, currently involved with the
            <a href="https://www.sabordelvalle.org/">Sabor de Valle festival</a>
            in San Jose into a larger event that supports Rotaplast. I have a son that lives in the Willow Glen area
            and he keeps me technically savvy since that is his field of expertise. I love to travel to experience other
            cultures.

                    prepping our house for sale. Because you went out of your way for us even during
                    the COVID shutdown, you got our house listed a week ahead of the
                    many others that got listed when the county opened up. Your effort gave our
                    house sale the early edge of opening to the market which gave it more views
                    before other homes. And it sold so quickly! Since I first got your call on March
                    15, you have saved me from anxiety, and was able to fully trust and rely on you
                    Because of your professionalism. To us, you have really been an angel sent to
                    help us by The Lady of Peace. Thank you very much from the bottom of our hearts.
